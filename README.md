  - JWT stored in HTTP headers for secure communication.
  - Token expiry and refresh logic managed to protect routes and sessions.

- **Profile Update**:
  - Users can update fields like `name`, `email`, `location`, and `skills`.
  - All changes are reflected in MongoDB through secured routes.
- **Authorization**:
  - Only the authenticated user can update their profile.
  - Uses middleware to verify tokens and access roles.

### 5.  AI-Powered Job Recommendation System

This is the core intelligence of the platform.

####  How It Works:
- User submits resume text or skill keywords.
- The system compares it against job descriptions in the database.
- Uses CohereAI  API (or mock if in development) to evaluate:
  - Skill match
  - Experience fit
  - Overall compatibility

####  Sample Prompt to AI:

```js
const prompt = `
Match the candidate to the job description.

Resume:
${resumeText}

Job Description:
${jobDescription}

Provide:
- Summary of compatibility
- Matching percentage
`;
